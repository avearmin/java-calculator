# java-calculator
A basic console based calculator created with Java.

This project is from a university based Intro to Programming course. Students
were asked to create a basic console based Java calculator program that can 
operate in two modes: Standard and Scientific. 

The Standard mode will allow the user to perform the following operations: 
(+, -, *, /) add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

The Scientific mode will allow the user to perform the same functionality as the
Standard add, subtract, multiply, and divide (+, -, *, / ) plus the following: 
sin x, cos x, tan x.

The calculator should be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division of two or more numbers but perform sin x, cos x, and tan x of one 
number only (the number is in radians).

The course up to this point has covered the following topics:
    - Variables / Assignments
    - Console Input / Output
    - Branches
    - Loops

While students are working on the project the course is also concurrently 
covering user-defined methods.
